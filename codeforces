Write a function matrix_mirrored that accepts an 𝑛×5
 matrix and returns true when all rows of the matrix are the same when written in reverse (and returns false otherwise). Your function must have the following contract:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

// matrix_mirrored(n, A) returns true exactly when all rows of the n x 5 matrix A are
//   "mirrored", i.e., the exact same when written backwards
// requires: 1 <= n <= 10
bool matrix_mirrored(const int n, const int A[][5]);
The first line of input given to your program will be an integer 𝑛
 representing the number of rows of the input matrix 𝐴
, followed by each entry of the input matrix given row by row.

In main, read 𝑛
 and the entries of the matrix 𝐴
 using calls to scanf, then call your function matrix_mirrored on 𝑛
 and 𝐴
. The output of your program should be the single line containing Y if the matrix is "mirrored" or N if the matrix is not "mirrored" (note the line ends with a newline character).

Note. You can assume the input follows the given specification.

If your compiler does not support variable-length arrays you can define 𝐴
 as a 10×5
 array because the maximum number of rows of 𝐴
 will be 10.
